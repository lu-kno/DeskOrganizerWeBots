# Movement

the wrist of the robot now follows the target while positioning the hand/gripper downwards
gripper is closed with "Q" and opened with "E"
starting position is reset with "R"
position data is printed with "F"

"WASD" moves the sphere around in X-Y directions
SPACE and SHIFT+SPACE move the sphere UP or DOWN respectively

Movement directions make sense when "standing" in front of the robot
