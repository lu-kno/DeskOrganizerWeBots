1.3.2 pore formation !!! This one i simply removed, consider adding it again. only classification is done !!!!!!!!!1
        1.4 porosity identification -> intro
        1.4.1 Radiographic inspection -> i might need to remove this part but the following would need fto be modified. 
1.6 model selection
    1.6.1 No free lunch theorem
    1.6.2 cross validation
1.6.3 Final model test


3.4 Selection of relevant Features
3.4.1 Histogram visualization of variables
3.4.2 Correlation Analysis



4 Model Selection and Training
4.1 Model Selection
4.2 Model Training
4.2.1 Train Test split
4.2.2 weld Section optimal overlap determination

4.3 Model validation
    - Increased Weld Section overlap for prediction -> increased redundancy of data 
4.3.1 Defining acceptable tolerances for prediction performance.
4.3.3 Measured vs Predicted values

4.4 Evaluation of the validation results



5 Discussion of results
5.1 Conclusion
5.2 Limitations of the chosen method
5.3 Areas for improvement






        The following block is done. YAYY! Its only missing zoomed in figures to show porosity detection
        2.2 Weld evaluation -> intro
        2.2.1 Non destructive testing
        2.2.1.1 Visual inspection
        2.2.1.2 Radiographic Inspection
        2.2.2 Radiographic Image Analysis
        2.2.2.1 ROI and porosity identification
