Week & Tasks\\ \hline
1 & I was introduced to my coworkers and started setting up the computer with all the required software for my future tasks. I started to get acquainted with the testing procedure and accompanied a colleague in a test drive
\\
2 & Finished setting up the software required in the company's laptop. 3 test drives were made and I made the revision of the evaluation results of the failed conditions in order to validate the failure or not.
\\
3 & One test drive was performed, I was assigned to run the evaluation and analyze the results in order to find the reason for the failed conditions and assess if they were critical or not. I also then assigned with the revision of test results from the HIL (Hardware-In-Loop). Some logs needed to be collected from the reports and I wrote a python scripts that extracted the necessary information from the various files in the project and outputted a file containing the list with the necessary information.
%1 test drive was made and I ran the evaluation script on my computer and revised the results in order to find the reason for the failure of the conditions and assess if it is critical or not. On Wednesday, I was given the Task to revise the test results of a HIL project (SCW). I needed to collect data (Error Flags from the Error Memory) from the multiple test reports and order them in such way that they can be put into an xlsx File to automatically modify the test parameters. This was a repetitive task, so i wrote a short script that sorted a list of errors and removed duplicate entries. I have made a program which takes every Error entry from the Reference test and outputs them to a .txt file formatted correctly to directly paste this information in a xlsx File to the automatic modification of the tdf test scripts. At the end of the week i was given another HIL project (SCQ) to revise its test results. The automatic test scripts didn't work as expected and some conditions have to be modified/commented out.
