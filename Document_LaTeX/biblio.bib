ABSTRACT = {Weld defects such as blowholes and surface pores occur due to zinc vaporization during the gas metal arc welding of lap fillet joints of Zn-coated steel. In this study, the effect of porosity on fatigue behavior was investigated. A Zn-coated steel sheet with the strength of 590 MPa and a thickness of 2.3 mm was used as the base material. Three kinds of specimens with weld pore defects, such as blowholes and surface pores, were prepared and the tensile shear strength, hardness and fatigue behavior were investigated. The pore defects in the welds reduced the tensile shear strength. In the fatigue test, at higher load stresses between 122 and 366 MPa, pore defects reduced the fatigue life of the weld. However, the pore defects in the welds did not significantly affect the fatigue life of the welds at stresses below 92 MPa.},

abstract={This study involves an investigation of the effects of the welding current and torch position parameters, including the travel angle, torch-aiming position, and work angle, on reducing the weld porosity in the cold metal transfer (CMT) welding of hot-dip galvannealed steel in the lap-joint configuration. The effects of the welding parameters on the weld porosity are investigated through statistical analysis, high-speed imaging of the weld pool behavior, welding signal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The magnitude of the welding current influences the weld porosity and weld pool behavior because the current determines the arc force, the heat input, the amount of zinc vaporization, and the weld pool viscosity. The torch position parameters also have considerable effects on the weld porosity because they determine where the arc, arc force, and heat input are concentrated. A response surface model relating the welding parameters and the amount of weld porosity is estimated, and the optimum welding conditions and a suitable welding range are determined on the basis of the estimated model to minimize the weld porosity in the CMT welding of hot-dip galvannealed steel.},

ABSTRACT = {In the process of welding zinc-coated steel, zinc vapor causes serious porosity defects. The porosity defect is an important indicator of the quality of welds and degrades the durability and productivity of the weld. Therefore, this study proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-based non-destructive testing method that can detect and predict porosity defects in real-time, based on welding voltage signal, without requiring additional device in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. To this end, a galvannealed hot-rolled high-strength steel sheet applied to automotive parts was used to measure process signals in real-time. Then, feature variables were extracted through preprocessing, and correlation between the feature variables and weld porosity was analyzed. The proposed DNN based framework outperformed the artificial neural network (ANN) model by 15% or more. Finally, an experiment was conducted by using the developed porosity detection and prediction system to evaluate its field application.},

  abstract={Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

abstract={Storing and using specific instances improves the performance of several supervised learning algorithms. These include algorithms that learn decision trees, classification rules, and distributed networks. However, no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a framework and methodology, called instance-based learning, that generates classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most, minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.},

A number of "no free lunch" (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori "head-to-head" minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, lap joint experiments were conducted using galvanized high-strength steel, SGAFH 590 FB 2.3 mmt, which was applied to automotive chassis components in the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. Zinc residues were confirmed using a semi-quantitative energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the porosity in the weld. In addition, a tensile shear test was performed to evaluate the weldability. Furthermore, the effect of porosity defects, such as blowholes and pits generated in the weld, on the tensile shear strength was experimentally verified by comparing the porosity at the weld section of the tensile test specimen with that measured through radiographic testing.},
